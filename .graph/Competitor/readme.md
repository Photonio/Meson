 | Regardless of whether you use one of the XML translation utilities like Intelligent Assistants XtoCC- you're going to have to accept that X has editing constructs that simply don't exist in other NLEs - so there is never going to be a translation that happens without problems. For example, there are X capabilities like Auditions, Compound Clips, Synchronized Clips, video clips with (trackless) embedded audio - and dozens of other attributes of an X edit that simply don't have exactly matching capabilities in a tracked timeline. A simple example would be that If I put a cutaway shot of a car door closing five tracks above my Primary storyline - in X there's no reason to put the Sound clip that matches that shot 5 levels BELOW the Primary. Just put the car door sound clip directly beneath its matching video clip all "above the line" so you can work on them both as a visual unit. The FCPXML that describes that has no easy way to map to plain XML without serious human interpretation. And so it goes.
